If there is an emoji of red apple  (&#x1F34E;) it means that i had to do a lot of research to achieve this goal.

If there this emoji  (&#x1F536;) it means i've had to remember stuff i've learned to achieve this goal.

If the color of the goal is green apple (&#x1F34F;) it means i've had no problems what so ever with this goal. 


## Goals

- [x] 1. Create a simple HTML template with some styling(&#x1F34F;)
- [x] 2. On this template you need an input field, a button and a table below(&#x1F34F;)
- [x] 3. Give the button some nice styling (no HTML default button!) and the text "Add to shopping list ()"(&#x1F34F;)
- [x] 4. When the button is clicked a spinner icon should appear inside the button (and it should spin)(&#x1F34F;)
- [x] 5. After .5 seconds the spinner should disappear again(&#x1F34F;)
- [x] 6. When you click the button and the input field is empty, display an error after the previous set animation (.5s)(&#x1F536;)
- [x] 7. When you click the button and the input field is **NOT** empty, then add the value to a table (in a new row) (also after the animation)(&#x1F34E;)
- [x] 8. After the item is added to the table, reset the field (empty it out)
- [ ] 9. In between the parentheses, put the amount of current groceries in the table (make sure it's always correct going forward in this exercise)
- [ ] 10. In the table row, put a cross icon, make it clickable, when clicked it should delete the row
- [ ] 11. Add a button below the table, it should say save
- [ ] 12. When the button is clicked, it should save the groceries list in the local storage of the browser
- [ ] 13. When you reload the page, there should be 0 difference (groceries list remembered, crosses still clickable, ...)
- [ ] 14. Every new row that's added to the table should be slightly darker than the previous one (so it kind of creates a gradient from white to grey)
- [ ] 15. When you delete a row, the background colors of the rows below should shift up in brightness (as if no difference is visible)
- [ ] 16. Add an edit button next to the delete button, when clicked, it should change the grocery cell content into an input element with the cell's content as value
- [ ] 17. When you change the value (or you don't) and press enter, then the input element should change into regular content with the update value
- [ ] 18. Add a cross next to the first input field (top of the page) when it's value is not empty, clicking this cross empties out the field
- [ ] 19. When you add a grocery item, check whether it has already been added to the table, if so, display an error about it and don't add it 
- [ ] 20. When you type clear in the first input box and press enter (not when you click the button!), it should clear out the entire table
- [ ] 21. When you type randomize and click the button (not when you press enter), you should randomize all the groceries in the table
- [ ] 22. When you remove a row in the table by clicking the cross, then animate the row out before actually deleting it
- [ ] 23. When you press the delete key and you're hovering over one of the rows, then delete it as you would when the cross would've been pressed
- [ ] 24. Add a delete button next to the add button, when you click it, it should search the table for a grocery with the name of the input field's value and if it finds it, delete it, otherwise show an error
- [ ] 25. Add a title to your page (that shows up in the current tab):  `The impossible game!`
- [ ] 26. Add a button next to the save button, that says `Go do groceries`, when clicked a **browser**notification popup should tell you to have fun at the store, also delete entire content of the table
- [ ] 27. Create a button in the top right of the table header, with a plus in there
- [ ] 28. When you click the button toggle between a plus and  minus icon
- [ ] 29. When the icon is minus, the table should be visible, when it's plus it should be **in**visible
- [ ] 30. Animate this change when you click the button!
