## Goals
* [x] HTML5 canvas that renders the game;
* [ ] Button that allows you to start the game;
* [x] Score field that keeps track of the score;
* [x] The snake is controlled through the arrow keys;
* [x] Make sure the code is commented properly.
* [ ] This page **MUST** be styled nicely!

* [x] The snake is always moving while the game is going on;
* [x] When the snake collides with itself, the game is over;
* [x] When the snake collides with a wall (read: canvas border), the snake needs to come out on the other side;
* [x] There is always a piece of food on the field;
* [x] Whenever the snake eats a piece of food, it grows in size by 1, and the player's score increases;

* [ ] Allow the player to choose the color of the snake, use an `<input type="color"/>` for this functionality;
* [ ] Make it so the snake's head has an opacity of 1 and it gradually decreases towards the snake's tail;
* [ ] Whenever the snake eats a piece of food, it needs to start moving a little bit faster;
* [ ] Keep track of the high score in case multiple games are played, and display this high score on the web page;
* [ ] Do the above linked to a username (no login required), let the user select a username when the page is loaded;
* [ ] Display the highscore of the current user as well as the top three user's scores ever;
* [ ] Make a difficulty selector, the harder the difficulty, the higher the base speed and the incremental steps;
* [ ] Allow the user to select a background and / or a soundtrack to play on;
* [ ] When the user loses, display "Game over", after a couple of seconds, display "Insert coin" (or anything similar if you want to use your creativity :wink: );

- [x] Learning to code DRY. (**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself)
- [x] Learning to read someone else's code and change it.
- [x] Showing you understand code by writing comments.
